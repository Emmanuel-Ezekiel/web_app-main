## Application Standards

This document provides TipTopp's point of view on several topics regarding [React](https://www.reactjs.org) application development. We consider the information here to be a set of "best practices" that we try to apply when building [React](https://www.reactjs.org) apps.

Although we generally expect our engineers to follow these standards, we recognize that there are many ways to build [React](https://www.reactjs.org) apps. If you have a differing opinion on some implementation, tips, or ideas to share, or see something that seems incorrect, feel free to start a conversation in our engineering group chat.
